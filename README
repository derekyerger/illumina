# Illuminata sensor processor

This project is a culmination of various microcontroller firmwares intended to provide expressive lighting for the CYBORG character I have been developing over the past few years

# Intended use

The not-for-profit license assigned to this repository intends to bind my work to a free to use space. Free, as in "libre," for anyone to use as a vehicle for learning about concepts in low level programming, use of body-worn sensors, code techniques and developing simple tools that help express oneself with movement and lights

# Background

Some of the ideas I have developed from this concept spring from attempts to make a prosthetic that becomes as good or better than the fleshy one I lost on July 4th 2006. A project of passion, this serves as a catharsis and making light of a series of unfortunate events that resulted in the loss of most of my fingers.

I hope that the groundwork laid here will go on to help people. Some of the use cases I forsee this benefitting are:

- entertainment and showmanship, such as the CYBORG character I don when I want to spread positivity in a dark world
- tools for low performing individuals with autism, where sensory overload requires much less harsh ways of interacting with one's own environment
- room lighting, specifically when it comes to simple interactive lighting which is less boring than RGB bulbs

# Technical details

At its core, the outputs of this system target commodity RGBW lights. The processing translates to one or more collections of lights, from sensors such as orientation, pressure, sound, etc.

As it stands alone, the system has one or more states that can be switched between based on a progression of movements. Each function representing a way of processing inputs is held in a function with internal state, and will potentially be dynamically iterated over using machine learning, to better express oneself with a physical representation of abstract concepts and emotions.
